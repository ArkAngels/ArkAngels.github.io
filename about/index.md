About meh.

* ### Who?
  My nickname is ArkAngels. For some reasons sorry I can't tell you my real name.
* ### Why here?
  As you can see in **[Petir](https://petircysec.com)** all of the writeups are written in Indonesian. Why? because we are aiming to share knowledges about information security to Indonesian people who want to learn but limited to the language. So I want to make this blog to write writeups in English and also to improve my written skills in English.
* ### Only Vulnhub and CTF? No HTB?
  Yes, as for my current skill, I haven't been able to solve any HTB boxes. And as for me, apart from CTF, I don't really like to pentest something with race against time (yet) and Vulnhub is a perfect environment for me to learn about pentest world with no time limit. Why? Because actually my learning pace is slow so I tend to need more time to learn about something and I'm quite happy in doing Vulnhub. Maybe in the future when I'm able to solve HTB box I will share my PoC (Proof of Concept) here.
